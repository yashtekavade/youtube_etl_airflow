# 📊 YouTube Comments ETL & Analysis Project

## 🚀 Overview
This project showcases a streamlined ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for retrieving and analyzing YouTube video comments using the YouTube Data API. It extracts viewer feedback and transforms it into actionable insights to help content creators enhance their engagement and content quality.

---

## 💡 Motivation
After completing a data pipeline tutorial, I wanted to give back to a YouTuber whose educational content played a big role in my learning journey. Discovering that YouTube comments could be accessed programmatically sparked the idea for this project — a way to collect, process, and understand audience feedback at scale.

---

## 🔧 Features
- **📥 Data Extraction** – Retrieves all comments from a target YouTube video, handling pagination for large volumes.
- **🔍 Data Transformation** – Processes raw responses to extract author info, text content, and timestamps.
- **💾 Data Loading** – Stores cleaned comment data into CSV format for easy access and further analysis.
- **🧠 Insight Generation** – Uses ChatGPT to prioritize and summarize key feedback, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions.
- **📅 Automation** – Optionally integrates with Apache Airflow to schedule and monitor the ETL pipeline.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- [Google API Python Client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client)  
- Pandas  
- Apache Airflow  
- OpenAI ChatGPT

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🔑 1. Enable YouTube Data API & Get API Key
1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create or select a project
3. Enable **YouTube Data API v3**
4. Navigate to **Credentials** → create an **API Key**
5. (Optional) Restrict the key for security

---

### 📦 2. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install google-api-python-client pandas apache-airflow
```

---

### 📂 3. DAG & ETL Configuration
- **Place DAG file:**  
  Copy `dags/youtube_comments_etl_dag.py` into your Airflow DAGs folder  
  - Linux/macOS: `~/airflow/dags/`  
  - Windows: check your Airflow config for the DAGs location

- **Make ETL script importable:**  
  Ensure `src/fetch_all_comments.py` is within your Airflow environment’s `PYTHONPATH`

- **Set YouTube API key environment variable:**  
  ```bash
  export YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
  ```  
  Or configure it in the Airflow UI via **Variables** or **Connections**

---

### 🖥️ 4. Run Airflow Services
In separate terminals:
```bash
airflow scheduler
airflow webserver
```

Visit the Airflow UI at: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

---

### 📈 5. Trigger DAG Execution
- DAG runs automatically once daily (`@daily`)
- You can also trigger it manually via the Airflow UI

💾 Comments will be saved to: `data/comments.csv`
